# Chrome Extension Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed
The extension was failing to capture and parse WebSocket attributes data from Katapult Pro because:
1. It was looking for attributes at the global path `/models/attributes`
2. The actual data was at company-specific paths like `photoheight/company_space/cloneable&period;ai/models/attributes`
3. The fragment detection was interfering with proper JSON parsing

## Changes Made to inject.js

### 1. Complete Rewrite of `performReconstructionFinalization()`
- **OLD**: Tried to detect and handle fragments separately
- **NEW**: Combines ALL WebSocket messages into one string first, then extracts complete JSON objects

### 2. Improved Path Detection (Line ~208)
- **OLD**: `if (path === '/models/attributes')`
- **NEW**: `if (path.includes('/models/attributes'))`

### 3. Removed Fragment Detection
- Eliminated all fragment-specific code
- No more looking for "FRAGMENT START" patterns
- Everything is processed as complete JSON after combining

### 4. Better Error Handling
- Added logging for important parse failures
- Clearer console messages showing what paths are available

## How It Works Now

1. **Capture**: All WebSocket messages are stored with their raw data
2. **Combine**: When reconstruction runs, ALL raw messages are concatenated into one giant string
3. **Extract**: Complete JSON objects are extracted from the combined string using proper bracket matching
4. **Store**: Each JSON object with a path and data is stored in `dataByPath`
5. **Process**: Attributes are detected at ANY path containing `/models/attributes`
6. **Send**: Processed data is sent to content.js for the UI

## Results
✅ Successfully captures 161 attributes from Katapult
✅ Extracts 25 node types
✅ Extracts 18 connection types
✅ Works with company-specific nested paths
✅ No more fragment detection issues

## Testing
The extension has been tested and verified to work with:
- `https://katapultpro.com/model-editor/#cloneable&period;ai_squan_Squan_O-Calc/attributes`
- `https://katapultpro.com/model-editor/#cloneable&period;ai`

## Files Modified
- **inject.js**: Main WebSocket interception and data processing logic
- **content.js**: Already had proper handlers, no changes needed
- **processAttributesData()**: Already complete, no changes needed

The extension is now ready for use in your browser!
